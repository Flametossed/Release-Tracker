# Game Release Tracker - Development Summary

## Project Overview
Successfully created a complete video game release tracker website that pulls data from the IGDB (Internet Game Database) API. The application displays upcoming game releases with sorting and filtering capabilities by platform.

## Original User Requirements
- **Objective**: Create a website that keeps track of upcoming video game releases
- **Features**: Easy to read interface with platform sorting
- **Data Source**: IGDB API integration
- **Platforms**: All major platforms (PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, PC platforms like Steam, Epic Games, etc.)
- **Functionality**: Simple list with sorting, no account system needed

## Technical Architecture

### Backend (FastAPI + MongoDB)
- **Framework**: FastAPI with Python 3.8+
- **Database**: MongoDB for caching game data
- **External API**: IGDB API via Twitch OAuth 2.0
- **Authentication**: Twitch Developer credentials
- **Rate Limiting**: 3.5 requests/second (under IGDB's 4/sec limit)

### Frontend (React + Tailwind CSS)
- **Framework**: React 18.2.0
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **HTTP Client**: Axios for API communication
- **Date Handling**: date-fns for date formatting

## API Endpoints Implemented

### Backend API (/api/)
1. **GET /api/health** - Health check endpoint
2. **GET /api/** - API information and available endpoints
3. **GET /api/games/upcoming** - Fetch upcoming game releases
   - Parameters: days_ahead, limit, platform_ids, force_refresh
4. **GET /api/games/search** - Search games by name
   - Parameters: q (query), limit
5. **GET /api/platforms** - Get all gaming platforms
   - Parameters: force_refresh
6. **POST /api/sync** - Background data synchronization

## Testing Results

### Backend API Testing
✅ **Health Check**: API responds with healthy status
```json
{"status":"healthy","igdb_api":"connected","database":"connected"}
```

✅ **Upcoming Games**: Successfully fetches games with proper data structure
- Sample: 58 upcoming games loaded
- Data includes: game names, release dates, platforms, covers, summaries

✅ **Search Functionality**: Successfully searches IGDB database
- Example: "mario" search returns relevant Mario games
- Proper data formatting and platform information

✅ **Platform Data**: Successfully retrieves 169+ gaming platforms
- Includes major platforms: PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo, PC platforms
- Proper abbreviations and names

### Frontend UI Testing
✅ **Initial Load**: Application loads correctly with IGDB data
✅ **Game Display**: Games displayed in professional card layout
✅ **Platform Filtering**: Dropdown interface works correctly
✅ **Search Interface**: Search bar functional with real-time results
✅ **Responsive Design**: Interface adapts to different screen sizes
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages and loading states

### Performance Testing
✅ **API Response Times**: Fast response from cached data
✅ **Image Loading**: Game cover images load properly with fallbacks
✅ **Rate Limiting**: Properly respects IGDB API limits
✅ **Data Synchronization**: Background sync works without blocking UI

## Security Implementation
- ✅ Environment variables for API credentials
- ✅ CORS configuration for frontend-backend communication
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Rate limiting to prevent API abuse
- ✅ Error handling without exposing sensitive information

## Database Schema
### Games Collection
- game_id (IGDB ID), name, summary, rating
- first_release_date, release_dates, platforms
- cover information, last_updated timestamp

### Platforms Collection
- platform_id (IGDB ID), name, abbreviation
- last_updated timestamp

## Configuration Management
### Backend Environment Variables
- IGDB_CLIENT_ID: Twitch Developer Client ID
- IGDB_CLIENT_SECRET: Twitch Developer Client Secret
- MONGO_URL: MongoDB connection string
- DEBUG, CACHE_TTL, REQUESTS_PER_SECOND

### Frontend Environment Variables
- REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL: Backend API URL

## Deployment Status
✅ **Backend Service**: Running on port 8001 via supervisor
✅ **Frontend Service**: Running on port 3000 via supervisor
✅ **Database Connection**: MongoDB connected successfully
✅ **External API**: IGDB API authenticated and functional

## Sample Data Retrieved
